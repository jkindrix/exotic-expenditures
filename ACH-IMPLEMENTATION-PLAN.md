# ACH Contribution System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing a custom Automated Clearing House (ACH) contribution system for Exotic Expenditures, allowing members to set up recurring scheduled contributions. The system will be tightly integrated with the existing website infrastructure and will utilize only Stripe and Plaid as third-party services.

## Goals

1. Create a seamless ACH contribution experience integrated with the existing website design
2. Allow members to securely connect their bank accounts using Plaid
3. Enable setup and management of recurring contributions through Stripe
4. Maintain a contributor ledger system for tracking all transactions
5. Ensure the system is secure, compliant with financial regulations, and provides a good user experience

## Technical Details

### Stripe ACH Integration

```javascript

async function createACHPaymentMethod(bankToken) {
  try {
    const paymentMethod = await stripe.paymentMethods.create({
      type: 'us_bank_account',
      us_bank_account: {
        account_holder_type: 'individual',
        account_number: bankToken.account_number,
        routing_number: bankToken.routing_number,
      },
      billing_details: {
        name: user.fullName,
        email: user.email
      }
    });
    
    // Store payment method to user profile
    await updateUserPaymentMethod(paymentMethod.id);
    
    return paymentMethod;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating payment method:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Plaid Integration

```javascript
// Example code for initializing Plaid Link
function initializePlaidLink() {
  const plaidHandler = Plaid.create({
    token: 'PLAID_LINK_TOKEN', // Generated on your server
    onSuccess: async (publicToken, metadata) => {
      // Exchange public token for access token on your server
      const response = await fetch('/api/exchange-plaid-token', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ 
          publicToken, 
          accountId: metadata.account_id 
        }),
      });
      
      const data = await response.json();
      if (data.success) {
        updateBankAccountUI(data.accountInfo);
      }
    },
    onExit: (err, metadata) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error('Plaid Link error:', err);
      }
    },
    onEvent: (eventName, metadata) => {
      console.log('Plaid event:', eventName);
    }
  });
  
  plaidHandler.open();
}
```

### Recurring Contributions Setup

```javascript
// Example code for setting up a recurring contribution
async function setupRecurringContribution(amount, frequency, startDate) {
  try {
    // Validate inputs
    if (!amount || amount < 1 || !frequency || !startDate) {
      throw new Error('Invalid contribution parameters');
    }
    
    // Create a Stripe subscription
    const response = await fetch('/api/create-subscription', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        amount: amount * 100, // Convert to cents for Stripe
        frequency,
        startDate,
        paymentMethodId: userPaymentMethodId
      }),

    const data = await response.json();
    
    if (data.success) {
      updateSubscriptionUI(data.subscription);
      return data.subscription;
    } else {
      throw new Error(data.error || 'Failed to setup subscription');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error setting up contribution:', error);
    showErrorMessage('Failed to set up your contribution. Please try again.');
    throw error;
