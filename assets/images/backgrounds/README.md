# Background Images

This directory contains background textures, patterns, and gradient images for the Exotic Expenditures website.

## Requirements

- Background patterns should be subtle and not compete with the content
- Textures should be tileable/seamless where appropriate
- File sizes should be kept minimal (under 100KB per background)
- Consider using CSS gradients instead of images where possible for better performance

## Recommended Backgrounds

1. `subtle-pattern.png` - A light texture for section backgrounds
2. `dark-texture.png` - A dark texture for footer and header areas
3. `gradient-overlay.png` - A semi-transparent gradient for image overlays

## Usage Guidelines

- Use backgrounds sparingly to avoid visual clutter
- Ensure text remains readable when placed over background textures
- Test backgrounds at different screen sizes to ensure they scale appropriately
