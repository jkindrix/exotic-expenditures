                            <p>We coordinate recurring ACH contributions from known group members into a pooled fund used for shared event expenses like meals, decorations, and celebrations. No products or services are sold. This supports non-commercial fund stewardship and accountability through a registered LLC. We're not a business in the traditional senseâ€”we don't seek profits or have customers. Instead, we're a structure that helps our members collectively fund adventures they couldn't afford individually.</p>

                            <p>Exotic Expenditures began when a group of friends realized they shared dreams of extraordinary experiences but couldn't afford them individually. Rather than letting these dreams remain unrealized, we created a structure to combine our resources. We established the LLC to provide legal protection and a framework for managing our collective funds.</p>

                            <p>Yes and no. We are a legally registered LLC, but we operate as a social fund rather than a traditional business. We don't sell products or services, and we don't seek to make profits. Our purpose is to create a legal structure for friends to pool money for shared experiences. Think of us more as a club with a formal legal structure than a business.</p>

Members who leave don't receive a refund of past contributions, as those funds have typically been spent on experiences. However, we do have provisions for distributing any accumulated assets if the collective were to dissolve completely.</p>

                            <p>All members sign a comprehensive liability waiver upon joining Exotic Expenditures. For higher-risk activities, we secure appropriate insurance coverage, which is factored into the event cost. Additionally, we only work with vetted, professional vendors who carry their own liability insurance. Our LLC structure provides an additional layer of protection for members.</p>
                            <p>While we take all reasonable precautions, adventure activities inherently involve some risk. We encourage members to maintain their own personal insurance coverage appropriate to their participation levels.</p>

                            <p>While we've had many incredible experiences, our most memorable was chartering a catamaran in the British Virgin Islands for a week. Twelve members participated, with costs shared equally. We visited remote islands, learned to sail together, and enjoyed incredible snorkeling spots that would be inaccessible to most travelers. The total cost per person was approximately 60% less than if anyone had attempted this trip individually.</p>

                            <p>For international adventures planned well in advance, we maintain a contingency fund of approximately 15% of the estimated total cost to account for currency fluctuations, unexpected fees, or price increases. If the contingency isn't needed, these funds roll back into our collective account for future adventures. For adventures with significantly variable costs, we sometimes collect an initial deposit and then finalize the remaining balance closer to the date when costs are more certain.</p>
