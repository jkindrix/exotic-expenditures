# Accessibility Audit - Exotic Expenditures Website

## Overview
This document presents the findings of a comprehensive accessibility audit conducted for the Exotic Expenditures website. The audit evaluates compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards and identifies areas for improvement to ensure the website is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## Audit Methodology
- Automated testing using Lighthouse, axe DevTools, and WAVE
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader compatibility testing (NVDA, VoiceOver)
- Color contrast analysis
- Review of semantic HTML structure
- Assessment of ARIA implementation

## Summary of Findings

### Strengths
- Proper use of semantic HTML elements throughout the site
- Implementation of ARIA landmarks and roles
- Inclusion of skip links for keyboard navigation
- Alt text provided for most images
- Good heading structure and hierarchy
- Form inputs have associated labels
- Keyboard focus styles are implemented

### Areas for Improvement

#### Critical Issues
1. **Missing Alternative Text**
   - Several images in the gallery section lack descriptive alt text
   - The image at line 304 (`<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563599175592-c58dc214deff?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80" alt="Private Chef Experience">`) needs more descriptive alt text

2. **Keyboard Traps**
   - The lightbox modals (adventure-lightbox and gallery-lightbox) can trap keyboard focus

3. **Color Contrast Issues**
   - The light gray text on white background in several sections has insufficient contrast ratio
   - The "Fun Fact" section has text that does not meet the 4.5:1 contrast ratio required by WCAG 2.1 AA

#### Moderate Issues
1. **ARIA Implementation**
   - Several elements with `aria-hidden="true"` are still keyboard focusable
   - Form validation errors need appropriate ARIA live regions

2. **Focus Management**
   - Focus is not properly managed when modals open and close
   - Focus is not visible on some interactive elements

3. **Dynamic Content**
   - The countdown timer lacks proper ARIA announcements for screen readers
   - Filter changes in the gallery don't announce results to screen readers

#### Minor Issues
1. **Form Improvements**
   - Form error messages could be more descriptive
   - Some form fields lack autocomplete attributes

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Some interactive elements are too small on mobile devices
   - Touch targets should be at least 44×44px per WCAG 2.1

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Add descriptive alt text to all images, especially in the gallery and experiences sections
2. Fix keyboard traps in modal dialogs by implementing proper focus management
3. Improve color contrast throughout the site, particularly in the "Fun Fact" section
4. Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible

### Medium Priority
1. Enhance ARIA implementation for dynamic content
2. Improve form validation with clear error messages and ARIA live regions
3. Implement focus management for all modal dialogs and custom widgets
4. Provide text alternatives for non-text content (animations, counters)

### Low Priority
1. Add autocomplete attributes to appropriate form fields
2. Increase touch target sizes for mobile users
3. Enhance screen reader announcements for dynamic content changes
4. Implement reduced motion alternatives for animations
