# GitHub Pages DNS Configuration for exoticexpenditures.com

## Current Configuration Issue
Your domain is currently pointing to Google hosting servers rather than GitHub Pages.

## Required DNS Configuration

### A Records
Your A records are correct and should point to GitHub Pages IP addresses:
- @ → 185.199.108.153
- @ → 185.199.109.153
- @ → 185.199.110.153
- @ → 185.199.111.153

### AAAA Records (IPv6)
Your AAAA record is correct:
- @ → 2606:50c0:8000::153

### Remove Conflicting Records
You should remove:
- The CNAME record for gbdrhjn6dds7 pointing to gv-t5365mxuir33zh.dv.googlehosted.com

### Keep Email Configuration
- Keep the MX record for SMTP.GOOGLE.COM as this is required for Google Workspace email functionality

### Add GitHub CNAME Verification (Optional but Recommended)
Add a TXT record:
- Host: _github-pages-challenge-USERNAME
- Value: The verification code from GitHub (you'll get this during setup)

## Steps to Fix
1. In your domain registrar's DNS settings, keep the A and AAAA records for GitHub Pages
2. Keep the MX record for Google Workspace email functionality
3. Remove only the CNAME record pointing to Google verification
3. In your GitHub repository:
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Enter your custom domain: exoticexpenditures.com
   - Check "Enforce HTTPS" once the domain is verified

## Verification
After making these changes:
1. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours)
2. GitHub will verify your domain automatically
3. Your site should then be accessible at https://exoticexpenditures.com
