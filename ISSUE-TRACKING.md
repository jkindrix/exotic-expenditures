# Issue Tracking System

## Overview
This document serves as the central tracking system for all issues, bugs, and enhancements related to the Exotic Expenditures website. It provides a structured approach to categorizing, prioritizing, and tracking the status of each identified issue.

## Issue Categories
- **A11Y**: Accessibility issues
- **PERF**: Performance issues
- **FUNC**: Functional bugs
- **UX**: User experience issues
- **COMPAT**: Browser compatibility issues
- **VIS**: Visual design issues
- **SEC**: Security concerns
- **ENH**: Enhancement requests

## Priority Levels
- **P0**: Critical - Must be fixed immediately (blocking release)
- **P1**: High - Must be fixed before production release
- **P2**: Medium - Should be fixed in current release cycle
- **P3**: Low - Can be addressed in future releases
- **P4**: Trivial - Nice to have, no timeline

## Status Definitions
- **Open**: Issue has been identified but not yet addressed
- **In Progress**: Work has started on resolving the issue
- **In Review**: Issue fix is complete and awaiting review/testing
- **Verified**: Fix has been verified by QA but not yet deployed
