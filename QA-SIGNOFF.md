## Approval Status

### Conditional Approval
Based on the test results and outstanding issues, this release is **conditionally approved** for production deployment, pending resolution of high-priority issues.

### Release Conditions
1. All high-priority issues must be resolved before public launch
2. Medium-priority issues should be addressed within two weeks after launch
3. Low-priority issues should be tracked and included in the next release cycle

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Summary

| Risk Area | Risk Level | Mitigation Plan |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Functionality | Low | Core functionality thoroughly tested with high pass rate |
| Compatibility | Low | Broad browser coverage with only minor issues in Safari |
| Accessibility | Medium | Critical accessibility fixes needed pre-launch |
| Performance | High | Mobile performance optimization required pre-launch |
| Security | Low | No security vulnerabilities detected |

### Recommendation
We recommend proceeding with the deployment plan once the high-priority issues have been addressed. A post-launch monitoring plan should be implemented to catch any unexpected issues in production.
