# QA Coordination Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the coordination processes and guidelines for quality assurance activities on the Exotic Expenditures website project. It is designed to facilitate efficient collaboration between QA, development, design, and product management teams to ensure a high-quality end product.

## Team Roles and Responsibilities

### QA Team (Agent 7)
- Create and maintain comprehensive test plans
- Conduct functional, accessibility, performance, and cross-browser testing
- Report and track issues using the established issue tracking system
- Verify bug fixes and enhancements
- Provide regular status updates on QA activities
- Conduct final pre-release validation

### Development Team
- Implement features according to specifications
- Address reported issues within agreed timeframes
- Participate in code reviews to ensure quality
- Follow best practices for accessibility and performance
- Communicate technical constraints and risks

### Design Team
- Provide design specifications that meet accessibility standards
- Collaborate on visual regression testing
- Address visual design issues identified during testing
- Ensure design implementation consistency

### Product Management
- Define acceptance criteria for features
- Prioritize reported issues in collaboration with QA
- Make go/no-go decisions based on QA findings
- Communicate project requirements and timelines

## Communication Channels

### Daily Stand-ups
- Time: 9:30 AM EST
- Format: Virtual meeting (15 minutes)
- Attendees: All team members
- Focus: Progress updates, blockers, and coordination needs

### QA Status Meetings
- Frequency: Twice weekly (Tuesday/Thursday)
- Time: 2:00 PM EST
- Duration: 30 minutes
- Attendees: QA team, tech lead, product manager
- Focus: Detailed QA status, issue review, and priority adjustments

### Issue Management
- Primary Tool: GitHub Issues
- Secondary Documentation: ISSUE-TRACKING.md (for high-level summary)
- Response Time: Critical issues - same day, High priority - 24 hours, Others - 48 hours

### Documentation Sharing
- Primary Location: Project repository in /qa-docs directory
- Format: Markdown for easy version control tracking
- Review Process: Pull request with at least one reviewer from each team

## Testing Processes

### Test Planning Phase

#### Inputs
- Product requirements
- Design specifications
- Development technical documentation
- Previous test results and issue history

#### Outputs
- Comprehensive test plan
- Test cases organized by feature area
- Testing timeline aligned with sprint schedule

#### Coordination Points
- QA reviews product requirements with product manager
- QA reviews design specifications with design team
- QA reviews technical implementation details with development team
- All teams approve final test plan

### Test Execution Phase

#### Testing Schedule
- Exploratory testing: Ongoing throughout development
- Feature testing: Immediately following feature completion
- Regression testing: Prior to each release
- Performance testing: At 80% feature completion
- Accessibility testing: At 80% feature completion
- Cross-browser testing: At 90% feature completion

#### Coordination Points
- Daily reporting of new issues discovered
- Cross-functional triage meetings for P0/P1 issues
- Weekly review of test progress in sprint meetings

### Issue Resolution Phase

#### Issue Lifecycle
1. QA identifies and documents issue
2. Development team acknowledges and estimates fix time
3. Product prioritizes issue
4. Development implements fix
5. QA verifies fix
6. Issue closed after successful verification

#### Coordination Points
- Joint triage of newly reported issues (daily if needed)
- Blocker resolution meetings when critical issues arise
- Fix verification timeline communication

### Release Validation Phase

#### Pre-release Checklist
- All P0/P1 issues resolved
- Regression test suite executed with passing results
- Performance metrics meeting targets
- Accessibility compliance verified
- Cross-browser compatibility confirmed

#### Coordination Points
- QA provides go/no-go recommendation
- Team reviews QA-SIGNOFF.md document
- Final approval from product, development, and QA leads

## Quality Metrics and Reporting

### Key Performance Indicators
- Test coverage percentage (target: >90%)
- Defect detection efficiency (bugs found in testing vs. production)
- Issue resolution time by priority
- Regression defect rate
- User-reported issues after release

### Reporting Schedule
- Daily: New issues and blockers
- Weekly: Comprehensive QA status report
- Pre-release: Final validation report
- Post-release: Quality retrospective

## Issue Prioritization Guidelines

### Priority Definitions
- **P0 (Critical)**: Blocks critical functionality or causes data loss
- **P1 (High)**: Significantly impacts user experience but has a workaround
- **P2 (Medium)**: Affects non-critical functionality or has acceptable workarounds
- **P3 (Low)**: Minor issues that don't significantly impact user experience
- **P4 (Trivial)**: Cosmetic issues or very minor improvements

### Escalation Process
1. QA team initially assigns priority
2. Development team may propose priority adjustment with rationale
3. Disagreements resolved in triage meetings
4. Product manager has final authority on priority

## Testing Environments

### Environment Access
- Development: dev.exoticexpenditures.com
- Staging: staging.exoticexpenditures.com
- Production: exoticexpenditures.com

### Environment Usage Guidelines
- Feature testing: Development environment
- Integration testing: Staging environment
- Performance testing: Dedicated performance environment
- Pre-release validation: Staging environment
- Post-release verification: Production environment

## Tools and Resources

### Testing Tools
- Functional Testing: Manual testing + Cypress
- Accessibility Testing: axe DevTools, WAVE, manual NVDA/VoiceOver testing
- Performance Testing: Lighthouse, WebPageTest
- Cross-browser Testing: BrowserStack, LambdaTest
- Visual Regression: Percy

### Documentation Resources

- PERFORMANCE-TESTING-RESULTS.md: Performance test results
- QA-SIGNOFF.md: Final release validation document
- ISSUE-TRACKING.md: Consolidated issue tracking

## Continuous Improvement

### Retrospective Process
- Post-release retrospective meeting
- Review of issues missed during testing
- Analysis of testing efficiency and coverage
- Identification of process improvement opportunities

### Knowledge Sharing
- Weekly tech talks (rotating presenters)
- Testing approach documentation
- Updating test cases based on new learnings
- Cross-training across different testing specialties
